### 📌 Project Description

This project is a **Football Player AI Agent** designed using the **PEAS framework**.
The agent operates in a simple 2D grid environment where it senses the ball and goal position, makes decisions, and performs actions to score a goal.

The main purpose of this project is to demonstrate **basic AI agent behavior, decision-making logic, and environment interaction** for academic learning.

### 🧠 Key Features

* Uses **PEAS (Performance, Environment, Actuators, Sensors)** model
* Agent senses ball and goal positions
* Rule-based decision making
* Simple football simulation on a 2D grid
* Beginner-friendly and easy to understand

---

### 🛠 Technologies Used

* Python
* Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook
* Basic Artificial Intelligence concepts

---

### 🎯 Objective

The objective of this project is to help students understand:

* How AI agents perceive their environment
* How decisions are made using conditional logic
* How actions are performed using actuators

---

### ▶️ How It Works

1. The agent is placed randomly on a grid
2. The ball and goal are positioned in the environment
3. The agent moves toward the ball
4. After gaining possession, it moves toward the goal
5. When the agent reaches the goal, it scores

### 📚 Use Case

This project is suitable for:

* AI / Artificial Intelligence assignments
* Agent-based system learning
* PEAS framework understanding
* Mini-projects for university coursework

---

### 🚀 Future Enhancements
